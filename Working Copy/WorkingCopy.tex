\section{Introduction}
The idea behind the 'Buzz' project is to find ways to enhance teaching and improve the learning of students through the use of online discussions.  The 'Buzz' will be an online forum where students can express their views on specific work topics, thus students will be able to see the work from other students perspective's and be able to discuss problems and find solutions creating an educational environment while allowing for social interactivity among students.

The idea is to create a fun, rewarding and educational environment, thus students will be rewarded for participating in this online forum by being 'leveled up' according to contributions on the forum. When a student reaches a new level he/she will have more privileges such as being able to start their own thread and having access to more functionality. All users will also be able to see each other's levels - in this way we try to motivate students to 'level up' to also receive those privileges.   

By having students communicating about work related to subjects the lecturers will also be able to view the discussions and thus see what problems and questions students have about the work and can address these again in class if needed. Lecturers on the other hand will also have a lot more privileges than students and can at any time start a new thread and discussions and so forth. 

The forum needs to be user-friendly to help inexperienced users to easily navigate and find their way around the forum thus it also needs to be well and logically organized. It should also raise excitement in students to want to participate in discussions or just go onto the forum and read about work covered during lectures to get a better understanding.
